# credit-card-validation ðŸ’³

This is one of the exercises from CS50 week 1. I felt really proud of it so I'm publishing it here.

This program uses the CS50 library. To compile make sure you have the CS50 library installed: https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/

The program simply checks credit card number validation by using the luhn's formula, it checks for these three card types: AMERICAN EXPRESS, MASTERCARD and VISA. Not every case is implemented but it should work for most of them. 

Feel free to try the program yourself and check the validity of your credit cardcredit cardðŸ¤©
