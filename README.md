# credit-card-validation üí≥

This program uses the CS50 library. To compile make sure you have the CS50 library installed: `https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/`

---
The program simply checks if the credit card is valid using the luhn's formula, it checks for these three card types: AMERICAN EXPRESS, MASTERCARD and VISA. Not every case is implemented but it should work for most of them. 

Feel free to try the program yourself and check the validity of your credit card
